Big Bang Testing:-
   All the modules are integrated and testing. It is a integration testing.
Mutation Testing:-
   Fault based Testing method or fault simulation testing method.

Slots and facets are used in (2014-June)
 (A) Semantic Networks 
 (B) Frames (yes)
 (C) Rules 
 (D) All of these
 
Explanation:- A frame language is a technology used for knowledge representation in artificial intelligence.
A frame has a set of slots, A slot represents a relation to another frame (or value). 
A slot has one or more facets, A facet represents some aspect of the relation


 _________ maintains the list of free disk blocks in the Unix file system. (NET-2014-June)
 (A) I-node 	(B) Boot block 		(C) Super block(yes) 		(D) File allocation table 
 Explanation:-
 A super block describes the state of the file system: the total size of the partition, the block size, pointers to a list of free blocks, the inode number of the root directory, magic number, etc.
 
 
 For a function of two variables, boundary value analysis yields
(A) 4n + 3 test cases (B) 4n + 1 test cases(yes)
(C) n + 4 (D) None of the above

For a program of k variables, boundary value analysis yields ______ test cases. (NET-2016-P2)
(A) 4k – 1		(B) 4k			(C) 4k + 1(yes)			(D) 2k – 1	
Explanation:-
For a program of k variables boundary value analysis yields 4 * k + 1 test
Robustness testing yields 6 * k + 1
worst case testing yields 5 * k.


The Best(desired) level of coupling is
(A) No coupling (B) Control coupling	(C) Common coupling (D) Data coupling(yes)
Explanation:-
The dependency between module A and B is said to be data coupled if their dependency is based on the fact they communicate by only passing of data.

The worst type of coupling is
(A) Data coupling. (B) control coupling.	(C) stamp coupling. (D) content coupling(yes)
Explanation:- Content coupling occurs when module A changes data of module B or when control is passed from one module to the middle of another


List – I ----------------------- List – II
a. Data coupling -------------- i. Module A and Module B have shared data
b. Stamp coupling ------------- ii. Dependency between modules is based on the fact 		they communicate by only passing of data
c. Common coupling ------------ iii. When complete data structure is passed from one module to another
d. Content coupling ----------- iv. When the control is passed from one module to the middle of another
Answer:-
(B) a - ii, b - iii, c - i, d - iv


All the modules of the system are integrated and tested as complete system in the 
case of
(A) Bottom up testing  (B) Top-down testing
(C) Sandwich testing   (D) Big-Bang testing(yes)

Changes made to an information system to add the desired but not necessarily the 
required features is called
(A) Preventative maintenance.		(B) Adaptive maintenance.
(C) Corrective maintenance.			(D) Perfective maintenance(yes)
