int check(int n){
    if(n <= 1)
        return 1;
    if(n % 2 == 0)
        return 1 + check(n / 2);
    else
        return 1 + check(n / 2 + 1);
}

check with 25 and 10

The modification of the software to match changes in the ever changing environment, falls under which category of software maintenance?
A.	corrective
B.	adaptive
C.	perfective
D.	preventive
Answer» B. adaptive

Changes made to an information system to add the desired but not necessarily the required features is called (TNSET)
1) Preventative maintenance 
2) Adaptive maintenance 
3) Corrective maintenance 
4) Perfective maintenance (yes) 


Tools to be used for Compiler Design

1) LEX -  produce tokens
2) YACC - produce parser to compile LALR(1) grammar
			The input of YACC is the rule or grammar and the output is a C program.
			
Which parser is more powerful?
   LR(0) < SLR < LALR < CLR   
   
   
Any syntactic construct that can be described by a regular expression can also be described by a (NET-2009-June-P2)
1) Context sensitive grammar  
2) Non context free grammar   
3) Context free grammar   
4) None of the above
Explanation: Context Sensitive grammer can not contain a empty string. A regular grammar can contain, so it can not be described by CSG. Option is C , Context free grammar. Option Non Context free is very general in nature and does not say anything which grammar it is so not counted it.
   
Any syntactic construct that can be described by a regular expression can also be 
described by a (TNSET)
1) Context sensitive grammar 2) Non-context free grammar 
3) Context-free grammar 	4) Both 1) and 2)  (yes)


A multiplexer combines four 100-Kbps channels using a time slot of 2 bits. What is the bit rate?  (NET - 2016 - July - p2)
1) 100 Kbps
2) 200 Kbps
3) 400 Kbps(yes)
4) 1000 Kbps
Explanation:-
Total bandwidth of input channels = 100 * 1000 * 4 bits/sec
Transmission time by all four channels in 2 bit slot is = 2/ ( 100 * 1000 *4 ) = 0.000005 mlsc
now question is in one sec how many bits you get are transferring ? 
That is = 1/(0.000005) *2 bits/sec = 400Kbps
